; callgraph.ini.sample - A sample configuration file for call graphs.
;
;
; The configuration parameters are:
;	SubGraphs:			A comma-separated list of subgraphs in the form TopLevelFunction.SubGraphEntryFunction.
;						Note that the function names are case sensitive.  The default value is an empty list.
;
;
;	EdgeColor:			The color used for edges.  Refer to the graphviz manual for more information on accepted
;						values.  The default value is 'black'.
;
;	EdgeStyle:			The style used for edges.  Refer to the graphviz manual for more information on accepted
;						values.  The default value is 'solid'.
;
;	EdgePenWidth:		The thickness of the pen used for drawing the edges.  The default value is 1.0.
;
;
;	NodeLabel:			The label used for nodes.  The default value is FunctionName.
;
;	NodeShape:			The shape used for nodes.  Refer to the graphviz manual for more information on accepted
;						values.  The default value is 'ellipse'.
;
;	NodeColor:			The color used for nodes.  Refer to the graphviz manual for more information on accepted
;						values.  The default value is 'black'.
;
;	NodeStyle:			The style used for nodes.  Refer to the graphviz manual for more information on accepted
;						values.  The default value is 'solid'.
;
;	NodePenWidth:		The thickness of the pen used for drawing the nodes.  The default value is 1.0.
;
;
; All configuration parameters with the exception of "SubGraphs" are SQL expressions.  You can refer to a number
; of columns, depending on the type of the element that configuration parameter affects.
;
; For Edges, the list of available parameters is:
;
;	EdgeNumCalls:		The total number of calls to this edge within the current graph.
;	MaxEdgeNumCalls:	The total number of calls to the edge with the most calls within the current graph.
;	AvgSelfTime:		The average amount of time per call spent in this edge within the current graph, excluding
;						time spent in child edges.
;	MaxAvgSelfTime:		The maximum AvgSelfTime of any edges within the current graph.
;	TotalSelfTime:		The total amount of time spent in this edge within the current graph, excluding time spent
;						in child edges.
;	MaxTotalSelfTime:	The maximum TotalSelfTime of any edges within the current graph.
;	AvgTotalTime:		The average amount of time per call spent in this edge within the current graph, including
;						time spent in child edges.
;	MaxAvgTotalTime:	The maximum AvgTotalTime of any edges within the current graph.
;	TotalTotalTime:		The total amount of time spent in this edge within the current graph, including time spent
;						in child edges.
;	MaxTotalTotalTime:	The maximum TotalTotalTime of any edges within the current graph.
;	NumPresent:			The number of call graphs this edge was part of.
;	NumGraphs:			Total number of call graphs within the top level function this graph is part of.
;
; For Nodes, the list of available parameters is:
;
;	FunctionName:		The name of the function this node represents.
;	NodeIsGraphEntryFunction:
;						True if this function is the entry point to the current graph, false otherwise.
;	NodeIsSubGraphEntryFunction:
;						True if this function is the entry point to another subgraph, false otherwise.
