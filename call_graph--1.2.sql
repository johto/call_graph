-- The first thing we need to do is to identify the callgraph each CallGraphBufferID represents.  We currently do this by
-- calculating the MD5 hash of the binary representation of an array that contains ROW(caller, callee) values ordered by
-- (caller, callee).  This hash can then be used to uniquely identify each call graph easily and efficiently.
--
-- In the below query, the subquery aggregates the data for each CallGraphBufferID, calculating the hash representation of
-- the edges.  At the same time, it pulls some additional data from the row where Caller = 0 (there should only ever be one
-- such row per CallGraphBufferID, so the choice of aggregate function shouldn't matter; I chose max) which is then stored
-- in the CallGraphs table.  Also note that we are grouping by (CallGraphBufferID, TopLevelFunction), which is effectively
-- the same as grouping by only CallGraphBufferID; there should NEVER be more than one TopLevelFunction for a
-- CallGraphBufferID.
--
-- After the subquery is done, we aggregate the data again, this time for each (TopLevelFunction, EdgesHash) pair.  This
-- way we can do the processing one callgraph at a time, rather than a CallGraphBufferID at a time.
